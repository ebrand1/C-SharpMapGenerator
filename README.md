# C-SharpMapGenerator
This repository contains several scripts for a simple 2D map generator written in C# for Unity

Specifically this map generator utilizes Unity's built=in Perlin Noise function to generate the map. Please note that this will only work in the Unity Editor currently, as UI functionality has not been added.
